This is a library implementing an A* algorithm for tree-search or graph-search purposes. This algorithm implements a best-first search strategy with a heuristic.
<p>

A typical example of application of the A* algorithm is to find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles. In this path-finding problem, a state is a path point. The cost function between two successive states can be chosen as the euclidian distance between two successive path points, and the heuristic can be the distance as the crow flies to the final destination.
<p>

The A* algorithm can be applied to many other problems, however. To allow you to customize the algorithm to your own needs, this library provides a generic A* algorithm in the form a functor taking as input a user-defined module. An example of implementation of such a module and of how to use the functor is given in subdirectory <code class="code">examples/PathFinder/</code>.
<p>

<h2 id="2_Installation">Installation</h2>
<p>

Download file <code class="code">A_star.zip</code> (or <code class="code">.tgz</code> or <code class="code">.gz</code>).
<p>

Decompress the file using <code class="code">unzip</code>, <code class="code">tar -zxf</code>, or <code class="code">gunzip</code>, depending on the file type.
<p>

Go to sub-directory <code class="code">A_star</code> and compile using command:
<pre class="verbatim">&gt; make</pre>
<p>

This command creates library files <code class="code">a_star.cma</code> and <code class="code">a_star.cmxa</code>, as well as an HTML documentation that can be found in subdirectory <code class="code">doc/</code>
<p>

<h2 id="2_Usage">Usage </h2>
<p>

Use the A* library as any other Ocaml library. The <code class="code">A_star</code> module of the library provides a functor allowing you to implement your own version of the A* algorithm on your own model.
<p>

A simple example of how to do that is available in subdirectory <code class="code">examples/PathFinder/</code>. To see the example running, go to this subdirectory, compile using command <code class="code">make</code>, and run the executable <code class="code">findpath</code> or <code class="code">findpath.norm</code>.
